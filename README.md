# Pandoc Word to Markdown Guide

The guide can be found [here](https://guagliardod.github.io/engl3814_a2/) and was written by Daniel Guagliardo.

## Project Description

This project aims to guide CS students who are trying to install and use Pandoc on a number of different Unix systems including MacOS, Arch Linux, Void Linux, Ubuntu, Debian Linux, and Fedora Linux.  If you are new to Pandoc and frustrated with the lack of good and readable documentation then you are in the right place.  Use the link above to visit the documentation which is hosted on by Github Pages.

## Requirements

There are two different types of topics found in this project, the first is the download and installing topic which requires different things than the how to topics require.  However, there is one shared requirement and that will be listed first.  Next, I will list the requirements for downloading and installing Pandoc and then list the requirements of the other topics.  Since you are reading this file on a computer I am going to assume you have a working computer and a working internet connection.

## Getting Started

There are four pages total, the index, welcome, word to markdown guide, and markdown to word guide pages.  The index page contains links to all of the pages with content.  The rest of the pages have a footer that links back to the index page.  Once you have the index page open the first place you should read is the welcome page.  Once you have read that you can then choose whatever guide you need.  However, the welcome page is not necessary if you have already read this document and are familiar with what a terminal looks like.
