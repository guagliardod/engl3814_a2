# The Basics of Pandoc on Linux

There is a complete lack of support for free and open source technology on campus, and it is time that things changed.  This documentation is focused towards MacOS and Linux users who have experience with the terminal.  The main goal of this guide is to help students who are trying to convert their proprietary workflow into a free and open source one.  This guide will cover how to build and install pandoc, how to convert a word file to a markdown file, and how to convert a markdown file to a word file.

## Before you get to the guides

A terminal is going to be needed not only to run Pandoc, but also to install it.  This is a common tool on Linux and less common on MacOS, however, I am assuming since you are CS students that you are familiar with getting a terminal open, if not below is an example of a Terminal on Fedora Linux.
